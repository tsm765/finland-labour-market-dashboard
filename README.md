# Finland Labour Market Dashboard

Analysis of Finland's labour market from Jan 2019 to Sept 2025 using Power BI.
This project had the aim to see how unemployment, vacancies and vacancy-to-unemployment factors change over time and across provinces and occupations in Finland.

## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an Labour Market Dashboard for Finland that:
Tracks unemployment and vacancy trends over time, compares provinces by unemployment and vacancies, highlights occupations with the highest demand, Provides KPIs with Month-over-Month (MoM) and Year-over-Year (YoY) tracking and finally summarises labour market trends via the vacancy to unemployment ratio.

## 2. Data & Sources

All data was procured from stat.fi
Population by labor market status, sex and age, monthly data (statfin135y),
Job vacancies at the end of the month by region (statfin12tv)
Unemployed job seekers in different groups, jobs in services and vacancies at the end of the month (statfin12rv)

## 3. Tools & Skills Demonstrated

Power BI Desktop
Power Query for data cleaning & transformation, Data modelling with relationships and calendar tables, DAX measures for KPIs, MoM/YoY %, ratios and moving averages, Slicers, cards, maps, bar charts and trend lines.
Data Modeling
Fact & dimension tables, Inactive/active relationships (USERELATIONSHIP)
Analytics
3-month moving averages, Ratios (vacancy to unemployment), Time-series analysis (MoM / YoY)

## 4. Dashboard and Visuals
Each page of the report deals with a specific case and they're broken down as below:
1. Unemployment Rate & 3-Month Moving Average
2. Vacancy : Unemployed Ratio by Province
3. Registered Unemployed by Province (Filled Map)
4. VBO Top 5 Global Roles by Province (Table-style Bar Chart)
5. VBO Top 5 Global Roles by Province (Column Chart)
6. Registered Unemployed – KPI + MoM/YoY 
7. Unemployment Rate – KPI + MoM/YoY
8. Vacancy Trend – KPI + MoM/YoY
9. Vacancy to Unemployment Ratio (VU)
10. Vacancies by Occupation

## 5. High Level Insights
Particular provinces within Finland have a high vacancy to unemployment ratio where attention from the government can be given to in placement of unemployed people. There are skill shortages in certain specific categories which the government and employers together can address through dedicated programs. To address the current bottlenecks, a dedicated approach towards optimization can help lessen the strain on the system.
